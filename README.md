# DPC
## About:
DPC is a minecraft account checker that checks through microsoft xbox login instead of the older mojang login.
it supports http(s), socks4, socks5 proxies but they must be pretty decent because microsofts authentication is very protective. it also uses tor proxies. it auto installs tor for you if selected also supports discord webhooks u can change the webhook URL from config.

## Proxy Format:
`user:pass@ip:port` and `ip:port`


## Captures:
- xbox game pass/xbox game pass ultimate accounts
- minecraft capes
- optifine cape
- email access
- last name change
- hypixel rank, level, first/last login, bedwars stars, skyblock coins, ban status

## Installing:
DPC ONLY SUPPORTS WINDOWS IT WILL NOT WORK ON LINUX OR MACOS
### [LINUX VERSION](https://github.com/8h3-coder/MSMC_Linux) (thanks to 8h3)

You do not need to install tor. Tor is automatically installed when selected for proxies.
